## Building package

This project uses React with the Chrome Extension.  

To build and further upload, side-load, or distribute the extension, run
`npm run build` which will create a `build` directory which should be pointed
to when loading into a Chromium type browser.  

As compared to a conventional Chrome Extension, the `manifest.json`,
`background.js` script, etc. are found in the `public` directory.  

The contents of React app are found in the `src` directory.
